Module 18 Challenge

Background: 
This challenge takes the scenario of a person working at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. If the company can predict whether a borrower
will repay their loan, it can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. My team has asked me to create a model to predict student loan repayment. 
Being given a CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients, and with knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used 
the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. 
The CSV file contains information about these students, such as their credit ranking.

Proceedures: 
Using the starter files in the "Model 18 Challenge files" and after creating this repository on Github, data had to be preprocessed for use on a neural network model.
Google CoLab, compiling and evaluating a model using a neural network took place using relu activation for the various layers. The evaluation of the model
using the test data determined the mode's loss and accuracy. The model was saved in Google CoLab and exported to a keras file and then named "student_loans.keras". 

Thoughts: This was a fun activity to complete, and although I still consider myself a non-coder/non-tech person, being in this course has taught me alot! I definitly plan on 
continuing my study of this topic well beyond the end of this course. Having the ability to replay the instructor's video and also being able to utilize the tutors helped 
tremendously in understanding how neural networks work. I have much to learn, but I've still learned a lot over the past few months, and I'm super excited about 
building more models in the future!
